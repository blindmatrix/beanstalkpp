Beanstalk++ is a client library for the beanstalk protocol, based upon boost.

The library is not feature complete yet, but the most commonly used functionality exists (putting
and reserving jobs and so on). Functionality which exists in the library should be considered 
stable, as it's used heavily in production environment.

CMake is required to build the project.

To compile:
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
$ make

To utilize the library, follow these steps:
- Include beanstalkpp.h in your files
- Add the beanstalk++ dir to your include path when compiling
- Add libbeanstalkpp.so to your makefile in the linker step

For some examples of using the library, have a look at the programs in beanspeek.cpp, beansput.cpp,
beansreserve.cpp and listtubes.cpp
